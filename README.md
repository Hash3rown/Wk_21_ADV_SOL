# Wk_21_ADV_SOL
Week 21 Advanced solidity work - NeilCoin

Crowdsale smart contract for a an ethereum-based token called "NeilCoin". This contract will manage the entire crowdsale process (allowing users to send ETH and get back NeilCoin), mint the tokens automatically, and distribute them to buyers in one transaction.

To begin the sale deploy the NeilCoinCrowdsale.sol file on an ethereum testnet (or main net if you're feeling spicy).

Cheers
